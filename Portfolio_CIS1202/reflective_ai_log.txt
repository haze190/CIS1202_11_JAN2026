Reflective AI Log

Initial prompt (to brainstorm a professional summary):
"I am a first-year IT student studying Computer Information Systems. I want a short professional summary (2-3 sentences) that highlights web development skills, technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and a collaborative learning mindset. Keep tone professional and concise."

Follow-up prompt (refinement):
"Shorten to two sentences, include 'responsive' and 'user experience', and keep it suitable for a portfolio hero section."

Notes on AI output and edits:
- The AI returned a 3-sentence paragraph; I asked for a 2-sentence version and it was revised accordingly.
- I removed any suggestions that used layout tables or inline styles; I kept only semantic HTML sections (<header>, <section>, <article>, <figure>, <footer>). 
- I ensured external links open in a new tab using target="_blank".
- Image is placed in the images subfolder and linked relatively as images/profile.svg.

Technical justification:
- Using semantic tags improves accessibility and document structure for screen readers and search engines.
- Keeping the page unstyled (no <style> tags or style attributes) meets the assignment constraint; styling can be added later in a separate CSS file.
